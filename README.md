# NUMERICAL-CALCULATOR
  Implemented by using array and stack data structures. Difficult to take numbers &amp; operators of different data types  with the same input statement. So, input in infix form which is taken as a string, is converted to array of characters in postfix form where nos  are substituted by q and numbers are stored in other array and result is calculated
