# NUMERICAL-CALCULATOR
Implemented by using array and stack data structures. Difficult to take numbers &amp; operators of different data types  with the same input statement.So,input(infix form) taken as a string, is converted to array of char (postfix form) where nos  are substituted by q and numbers are stored in other array and result is calculated by replacing q in postfix expn with numbers.
